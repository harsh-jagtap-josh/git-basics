***About***

The main branch and rest all branches may seem completely messed up, and main branch has commits in it.. but this Repo was completely created for learning basis, for revising all basic git commands and playing around with commands.
All of the above changes were done on a local repo and had to make it remote just to take a review...

Although the remote seems messed up, the complete logs for terminal of local repo where all commands were executed are stored in a text file named `GitBasi.cs Assignment` in branch `Feature 3`.
The text file depicts an exact copy of the terminal with all the commands and their outputs...
